I excel at building scalable, fault-tolerant software systems, facilitating well-designed products that deliver value to customers. I rollout (and advocate for) efficient processes and practices in product teams.

## Professional Experience

### **Software Engineer** at TomTom (2021 - Current, Berlin, Germany)

- Improved data extraction pipelinesâ€™ performance up to 60x by introducing deep learning-based modules on mobile devices and microservices (serverless using Azure Functions) replacing existing solutions. 
 - Designed streamlined APIs, resulting in reusable, user-friendly modules that developers introduced to 3 different partner data ingests.
 - Facilitated agile project retrospectives, fostering an open team culture. Over time, this resulted in dramatic workflow and process improvements. Team members appreciated the strong information flow.
 - Managed a Microsoft Azure subscription and GitHub repositories, ensuring good development practices and cross-tool integration for efficient progress tracking.

### **Software Engineer** at TomTom (January 2020 - 2021, Berlin, Germany)

 - Designed a V2C (Vehicle to cloud) system around a sensor set which enabled real-time stream-based processing of large amounts of heterogeneous data. The system was integrated on a demonstration vehicle validating current and next-gen distributed mapping concepts.
 - Integrated and overhauled Robot Operating System (ROS) modules, increasing system robustness. 
 - Ensured fault-tolerant operation by designing cost-effective simulated tests with real driving data.

### **Software Engineer** at Vision Dynamix (February 2017 - April 2019, Skopje, N. Macedonia)

 - Planned sprints with partners, accounting for budget and time constraints while delivering features
 - Showcased the product and did investor pitches, resulting with the first foreign investment in the start-up
 - Improved algorithms for aerial dense 3D reconstruction. Cut development time dramatically by introducing open-source components as a base for the proprietary software layers.
 - Significantly reduced configuration/setup time for Nvidia Jetson boards by automating the processes.

### **Software Engineer Intern** at Geocom Informatik AG (July 2016 - January 2017, Burgdorf, Bern, Switzerland)

 - Developed a geodatabase replication tool which prevented overwrites in suites of automated tests.

### **Teaching Assistant** at Faculty of Electrical Engineering and IT (2014 - 2016 and 2018, Skopje, N. Macedonia)

 - Held classes and lab exercises for groups of 10-20 students
 - Coached Logic Design, Object-oriented programming and compilers
